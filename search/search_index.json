During my undergraduate studies, I spent close to two semesters of research training in the university's cloud computing lab, experimenting with x86 kernel demo implementation and Linux file system research. </p> <p>My Bachelor's thesis is a study of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks for UAV Clusters.  During my studies, I learned about the interest in multi-intelligent systems. Its research ideology can solve problems that cannot be solved by traditional methods or provide a better solution to some problems like UAV clusters, or even social networks.</p> <p>In the future, I hope to conduct further research on multi-agent systems.</p> <p>Here is my  Curriculum Vitae. </p>"},{"location":"#research-interest","title":"Research Interest","text":"<p>Cooperative Control of Mobile Robots,  Agent-Based Model, Deep Reinforcement Learning</p>"}]}
